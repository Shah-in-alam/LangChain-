On the military front, the People's Liberation Army and the Pakistan Armed Forces share a notably close relationship; China has supported Pakistan's position on the Kashmir conflict, while Pakistan has supported China's position on Xinjiang, Tibet, the territorial disputes in the South China Sea, the Sino-Indian border dispute and the political status of Taiwan. Military cooperation between the two sides has continued to increase significantly, with joint projects producing armaments ranging from fighter jets to guided missile frigates. The overwhelming majority of Pakistan's arms imports are from China, and the country makes up the majority of China's arms exports. Both countries have generally pursued a bilateral policy that focuses to strengthen their alliance in all areas. While serving as China's main bridge to the Muslim world, Pakistan has also played an important role in closing the communication gap between China and the United States—namely through the 1972 visit by Richard Nixon to China. Recent rankings have described Pakistan as the country that is most under Chinese political influence.\", 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93Pakistan_relations'}\n",

      "Over the following decades a variety of maps were issued by all sides in the dispute, showing wildly varying boundaries. India and Pakistan inherited the dispute upon independence in 1947, further complicated by their dispute over ownership of Jammu and Kashmir. The issue came to the fore in the early 1960s, at a time of intense tension in the region due to ongoing failure to solve the Indo-Pakistani dispute over Kashmir, a much larger Chinese presence in Tibet, and the Sino-Indian War of 1962 in which China had seized control of the Indian-claimed Aksai Chin region. In 1961 China and Pakistan agreed in principle to demarcate their common border; negotiations commenced the following year, with the final Sino-Pakistan Agreement being signed in 1963. Both sides made concessions in the treaty, with Pakistan giving China the area around the Shaksgam Valley known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract. Following the treaty a series of maps and aerial surveys of the border area were made and boundary pillars installed.\n",

While Pakistan has also provided support to Iran in the Iran–Israel proxy conflict and served as a mediator in the Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict, Pakistan's support for Turkey in the Iran–Turkey proxy conflict is viewed with scepticism and distrust from Tehran. After the U.S. complete withdrawal of its troops and the Taliban return to power in the 2020s, Pakistan has stepped up cooperation with Iran to promote peace and stability in Afghanistan, but misaligned interests have hampered the process, with the 2024 Iran–Pakistan conflict, the issue of handling ties with Taliban, and economic conflict (as both nations are suffering immense economic crises) affected greatly their relations.\\nOn the other hand, Pakistan is one of the few countries where Iranian influence is positively received as per polls conducted by the Pew Research Center. Polls have consistently shown that a very high proportion of Pakistanis view their western neighbour positively. Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Khamenei has also called for the sympathy, assistance, and inter-cooperation of all Muslim nations, including Pakistan. Iran has also expressed an interest in joining the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor as part of the larger Belt and Road Initiative.\", 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Pakistan_relations'}\n"
